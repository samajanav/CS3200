Repository of work from CS3200 - Introduction to Databases

**1. Genes and Disease Associations:** Developed an analysis to identify the top genes associated with various diseases using the Genetic Association Database. Key findings highlighted genes with strong links to cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders, providing insights into potential research and treatment priorities.

**2. SceneSense Theater Database:** Designed a comprehensive database to manage theatrical productions, including play details, actor roles, character assignments, and rehearsal schedules. This system streamlines operations for theater companies, ensuring efficient management of cast and production logistics.

**3. Whale Adoption Database:** Built a database to track North Atlantic Right Whale sightings and automate notifications for adopters. This system enhances public engagement and supports conservation efforts by keeping adopters informed about whale activity and sighting locations.

**4. Adverse Drug Events:** The project involves creating a database system to prevent Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) using a stored procedure `prescribe` and a trigger for managing prescriptions. It includes database setup, procedure implementation, and test cases to ensure prescription safety by enforcing drug guidelines.
